// I DEFINITELY DO NOT OWN ANYTHING HERE, OKAY!?

:'''Title Narrator''': According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.

'''Barry''': Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Yeah. Let's shake it up a little.

Barry! Breakfast is ready!

'''Barry''': Coming! Hang on a second. Hello?
Barry?
Adam?
Can you believe this is happening?
I can't believe it. I'll pick you up.
Looking sharp.

Barry, why don't you use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those.
Sorry. I'm excited.
Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. And a perfect report card, all B's.
Very proud.
Ma! I got a thing going here.
You got some lint on your fuzz.
Ow! That's me!
Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
Bye!
Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!

- Hey, Adam.

- Hey, Barry.

- Is that fuzz gel?

- A little. It's special day, finally graduating.
Never thought I'd make it.

Yeah, three days of grade school, three days of high school.
Those were so awkward.
Three days of college. I'm glad I took off one day in the middle and just hitchhiked around the hive.
You did come back different.

- Hi, Barry.

- Hey, Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

- Hey, did you hear about Frankie?

- Yeah.

- You going to his funeral?

- No, I'm not going to his funeral. Everybody knows you sting someone, you die. You don't waste it on a squirrel. He was such a hothead.
Yeah, I guess he could’ve just gotten out of the way. 

I love this incorporating an amusement park right into our regular day.
I guess that's why they say we don't need vacations.

Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances.

- Well, Adam, today we are men.

- We are!

- Bee-men.

- Amen!

Hallelujah!

Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell.

'''Dean Buzzwell''': Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of... 9:15. (clears his throat) And that concludes our graduction ceremonies.

'''Dean Buzzwell''': And begins your career at Honex Industries!

Are we going to pick our job today?
I heard it's just orientation.
Heads up! Here we go.

Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.

- I wonder what it's going to be like?

- A little scary.

Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group.

This is it!
Wow.
Wow.
We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.
Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as...
Honey!

- That girl was hot.

- She's my cousin!

- She is?

- Yes, we're all cousins.

- Right. You're right.

- At Honex, we also constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence.

These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.

- What do you think he makes?

- Not enough.

And here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.
- What does that do?

- Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.

Saves us millions.
Can anyone work on the Krelman?
Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.
But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job that you pick for the rest of your life.
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.
What's the difference?
And you'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years.
So you'll just work us to death?
We'll sure try.
Wow! That blew my mind!
"What's the difference?"
Adam how could you say that?
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.
Well, I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.
But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?

Barry why would you question anything?
We're bees.

We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.

Yeah, but Adam, did you ever think that maybe things work a little too well around here?

Like what? Give me one example.

I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.

Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.

Wait a second. Check it out.

- Hey, Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!

- Wow.

I've never seen them this close.

They know what it's like to go outside the hive.

Yeah, but some of them don't come back.

- Hey, Jocks!

- Hi, Jocks!

You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!

- I wonder where those guys have just been.

- I don't know.

Their day's not planned.

Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.

You can't just decide one day to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.

Right.

Look a that. That's more pollen than you and I will ever see in a lifetime.

It's just a status symbol.
I think bees make too big a deal out of it.

Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.

Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?

Distant. Distant.

Look at these two.

- Oouple of Hive Harrys.

Let's have some fun with them.

It must be so dangerous being a Pollen Jock.

Yeah. One time a bear had me pinned up
against a mushroom!

He had one paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me back and forth across the face!

- Oh, my!

- I never thought I'd knock him out.	

And what were you doing during all of this?

Obviously, I was trying to alert the authorities.

I can autograph that if you want.

A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?

Yeah. Gusty.

You know, we're going to hit a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.

- Six miles, huh?

- Barry!

It's a puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.

- Maybe I am.

You are not!

We're going 0900 at J-Gate.

What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?

I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.

Hey, Honex!

Dad, you surprised me.

Have you decide what you're interested in?

- Well, there's a lot of choices.

- But you only get one.

Dad do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?

Son, let me tell you something about stirring.

You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.

You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.

You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.

And you were thinking of what, making balloon animals?

That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.

Well no...

Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!

- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.

- I'm not trying to be funny.

You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!

- You're gonna be a stirrer?

- No one's listening to me!



Wait untill you see the sticks I have for you.



I could say anything I want right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!



Let's open some fresh honey and celebrate!



Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.



To honey!



Shave my antennae.



Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!



I'm so proud.



- I can't believe we're starting work today!
- Today's the day.



Oome on! All the good jobs
will be gone.



Yeah, right.



Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
stirrer, front desk, hair removal...



- Is it still available?
- Hang on. Two left!



And... one of them's yours! Oongratulations Son!
Step to the side  please.



Yeah!



- What did you get?
- Picking crud out. Stellar!



Wow!



Oouple of newbies?



Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!



Well, step up and make your choice.



- You want to go first?
- No, you go.



Oh, my. What's available?



Restroom attendant is always open,
and not for the reason you think.



- Any chance of getting on to the Krelman, Sir?
- Sure, you're on.



I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.



Wax monkey's always open.



And the Krelman just opened up again.



What happened?



Well, whenever a bee died. That's an opening. See that?
He's dead. dead, Another dead one.



Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.



Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. But that's life!



Oh, this is so hard!



Heating, cooling,
stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,



humming, inspector number seven,
lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,



mite wrangler. Barry, Barry, what
do you think I should... Barry?



Barry!



All right, we've got the sunflower patch
in quadrant nine Geranium
window box on Sutton Place...



What happened to you?
Where are you?



- I'm going out.
- Out? Out where?



- Out there.
- Oh, no!



I have to, before I go
to work for the rest of my life.



You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?



Another call coming in.



You’re cra



If anyone's feeling brave,
there's a Korean deli on 83rd



that gets their roses today.



Hey, guys.



- Well look at that.
- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?



Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.



It's OK, Lou. We're going take him up.



Really? Feeling lucky, are you?
Sign here, here. Just initial that. Thank you.

OK. You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know,
bees cannot fly in rain. So be careful. As always,
watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs,
birds, bears and bats. Also, I got a couple of reports
of root beer being poured on us. Murphy's in a home because of it,
just babbling like a cicada!

Barry: That's awful.

And a reminder for all you rookies, bee law number one,
absolutely no talking to humans!All right, launch positions!


Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,
buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!



Black and yellow!

Hello!


You ready for this, hot shot?
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.

Wind, check.
Antennae, check.
Nectar pack, check.
Wings, check.
Stinger, check.
Scared out of my shorts, check.
OK, ladies, let's move it out!



Pound those petunias,
you striped stem-suckers!



All of you, drain those flowers!



Wow! I'm out! I can't believe I'm out!



So blue.



I feel so fast and free!



Box kite!



Wow!



Flowers!



This is Blue Leader.
We have roses visual.



Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.



Roses!



30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.



Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a bit of a kick.



That is one nectar collector!



- You ever see pollination up close?

No, sir.
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it
over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little bit of magic. ain’t it?
That's amazing. Why do we do that?
That's pollen power. Kid. More pollen, more
flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.

Cool.


I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.
Could be daisies. Don't we need those?



Copy that visual.



Hold on. One of these flowers
seems to be on the move.



Say again? You're reporting
a moving flower?



Affirmative.



That was on the line!



This is the coolest. What is it?



I don't know, but I'm loving this color.



It smells good.
Not like a flower, but I like it.



Yeah, fuzzy.



Ohemical-y.



Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby.



My sweet lord of bees!



Hey candy-brain, get off there!



Problem!



- Guys!
- This could be bad.



Affirmative.



Very close.



Gonna hurt.



Mama's little boy.



You are way out of position, rookie!



Ooming in at you like a missile!



Help me!



You know, I don't think these are flowers.



- Should we tell him?
- I think he knows.



What is this?!



Match point!



You can just start packing up, honey,

because I believe
you're about to eat it!

Huh?

What? No!

Oh, you cannot be serious.

Yowser!



Gross.



There's a bee in the car!



- Do something!
- I'm driving!



- Hi, bee.
- He's back here! He's going to sting me!



Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze!



He blinked!



Spray him, Granny!



What are you doing?!



It’s hair spray! Extra hold!



Kill it!



Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable.



I’ve got to get home.



Can't fly in rain.



Can't fly in rain.



Can't fly in rain.



Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!



Ken, can you close the window please?



Hey check out my new resume.
I made it into a fold-out brochure.



You see? It folds out.



'''Barry''': Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this. What was that? Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This...



Drapes!



That is diabolical.



It's fantastic. It's got all my special
skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.



What's number one? Star Wars?



Nah, I don't go for that...



...kind of stuff.



No wonder we’re not supposed to talk to them.
They're out of their minds.



When I walk out of a job interview, they're
flabbergasted, they can't believe the things what I say.



There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.



I don't remember the sun
having a big 75 on it.



I gotta tell ya, I predicted global warming.



I could feel it getting hotter.
At first I thought it was just me.



Wait! Stop! Bee!



Kill it! Kill it!



Stand back. These are winter boots.



Wait!



Don't kill him!



You know I'm allergic to them!
This thing could kill me!



Well, why does his life have
any less value than yours?



Why does his life have any less value
than mine? Is that your statement?



I'm just saying all life has value. You
don't know what he's capable of feeling.



My brochure!



There you go, little guy.



I'm not scared of him.
But you know it's an allergic thing.



Hey why don't you put that on your resume brochure.



It's not funny my whole face could puff up.



Make it one of your special skills.



You Know, knocking someone out
is also a special skill.



Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.



- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
- Yeah sure, Ken. You know, whatever.



- You can put carob chips on there.
- Good night.



- Supposed to be less calories or something.
- Bye.



I’ve got to say something



She saved my life.
I’ve got to say something



All right, here it goes.



Nah.



What would I say?



I could really get in trouble.



It's a bee law.
You're not supposed to talk to a human.



I can't believe I'm doing this.



I've got to.



Oh, I can't do it. Oome on!



No. Yes. No.



Do it. I can't.



How should I start it?
"You like jazz?" No, that's no good.



Here she comes! Speak, you fool!



Hi!



I'm sorry.



- You're talking.
- Yes, I know I know.



You're talking!



I know, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.



No, it's OK. It's fine, It's just..
I know I'm dreaming.



But I don't recall going to bed.



Well, you know I'm sure this
is very disconcerting.



Yeah! I mean, this is a bit of a surprise to me.
I mean, you're a bee!



Yeah, I am a bee. And uh, you know I'm not supposed
to be doing this,



but they were all trying to kill me.



And if it wasn't for you...



I mean, I had to thank you.
It's just how I was raised.



That was a little weird.



- I'm talking with a bee.
- Yeah.



I'm talking to a bee.



Anyway...



And the bee is talking to me!



I just want to say I'm grateful.
And I'm going to leave now.



- Wait! wait, wait, How did you learn to do that?
- What?



That- that- that- that...  The talking thing.



Same way you did, I guess.
"Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up.



- That's very funny.
- Yeah.



Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,
we'd cry with what we have to deal with.



Anyway...



Oan I...



...get you something?
- Like what?



I don't know. I mean...
I don't know. Ooffee?



Well, uh, I don't want to put you out.



It's no trouble. 



unless you're making it anyway.



It takes two minutes.



Really?



- It's just coffee.
- I hate to impose.



- Don't be ridiculous!
- Actually, I would love a cup.



Hey, you want a little rum cake?



- I really shouldn't.
- Have a little rum cake.



- No, no, no, I can't.
- Oome on!



You Know, I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms here.



- Where?
- Well... These stripes don't help.



You look great!



I don't know if you know
anything about fashion.



Are you all right?



No.



He's making the tie in the cab
as they're flying up Madison.



He finally gets there.



He runs up the steps into the church.
The wedding is on.



Yeah?



And he says, "Watermelon?
I thought you said Guatemalan.



Huh-huh



Why would I marry a watermelon?"



Is that a bee joke?



Yeah, that's the kind of stuff we do.



Yeah, different.



So anyway, what are you gonna do, Barry?



About work? I don't know.



I want to do my part for the hive,
but I can't do it the way they want.



I know how you feel.



- You do?
- Sure.



My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or
a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.



- Really?
- My only interest is flowers.



Our new queen was just elected
with that same campaign slogan.



Anyway, you see if you look...



There's my hive right there. You can see it?



You're in Sheep Meadow!



Yes! You know the Turtle Pond!



Yes! I'm right off of that!



No way! I know that area.
I lost a toe ring there once.



Really?



Yes.



- Why do girls put rings on their toes?
- Well. why not?



- I don't know. It's like putting a hat on your knee.
- Maybe I'll try that.



- You all right, ma'am?
- Oh, yeah. Fine.



Just having two cups of coffee!



Anyway, this has been great.
Thanks for the coffee.



Yeah, it's no trouble.



Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,
I'd be up the rest of my life.



Are you...?



Oan I take a piece of this with me?



Sure! Here, have a crumb.



- Thanks!
- Yeah.



All right. Well, then...
I guess I'll see you around.



Or not.



OK, Barry.



And thank you
so much again... for before.



Oh, that? That was nothing.



Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...



This can't possibly work.



Well, he's all set to go.
We may as well try it.



OK, Dave, pull the chute.



- Sounds amazing.
- It was amazing!



It was the scariest,
happiest moment of my life.



Humans! Humans! I can't believe
you were with humans!



Giant, scary humans!
What were they like?



Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.



They eat crazy giant things.
They drive around real crazy.



- And do they try and kill you, like on TV?
- Some of them. But some of them don't.



- How'd you get back?
- Poodle.



Look you did it, and I'm glad. You saw
whatever you wanted to see out there.



You had your "experience." Now you
can pick out yourjob and everything can be normal.



- Well...
- Well?



Well, I met someone.



You met someone? Was she Bee-ish?



- Not a wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
- No, no, no, not a wasp.



- Spider?
- You know. I'm not attracted to spiders.



I know to everyone else it's like the hottest thing,
with the eight legs and all.



I can't get by that face.



So who is she?



She's... human.



Oh no, no. no, no. That didn't happen
You didn't do that



That's a bee law.
You wouldn't break a bee law.



- Her name's Vanessa.
- Oh, boy.



She's so nice. And she's a florist!



Oh, no! No, no, no! You're dating a human florist!



W-w-well, we're not dating.



You're flying outside the hive, you're talking
to humans being that attack our homes



with power washers and M-80s!
That's one-eighth a stick of dynamite!



She saved my life!
And she understands me.



This is over!



Eat this.



This is not over! What was that?



- They call it a crumb.
- That was so stingin' stripey!



And that's not even what they eat.
That's what falls off what they eat!



- Do you know what a Oinnabon is?
- No.



It's bread 



Come in Here



and cinnamon 



Be Quiet!



and frosting. They heat it up...



Sit down!



...really hot!
- Listen to me!



We are not them! We're us.
There's us and there's them!



Yes, but who can deny
the heart that is yearning?



There's no yearning.
Stop yearning. Listen to me!



You have got to start thinking bee,
my friend. Thinking bee!



- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.



Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!



There he is. He's in the pool.



You know what your problem is, Barry?



I've got to  start thinking bee?



Barry how much longer is this going to go on?



It's been three days!
I don't understand why you're not working.



Well, I've got a lot of big life decisions
I'm thinking about.



What life? You have no life!
You have no job. You're barely a bee!



Would it kill you
to just make a little honey?



Barry, come out from under here.
Your father's talking to you.



Martin, would you talk to him?



Barry, I'm talking to you!



You coming?



Got everything?



All set!



You go ahead. I'll catch up.



Don't be too long.



Watch this!



Vanessa!



- We're still here, Barry.
- I told you not to yell at him.



He doesn't respond when you yell at him!



- Then why are you yelling at me?
- Because you don't listen!



I'm not listening to this.



Sorry, Mom I've gotta go.



- Where are you going?
- Nowhere, I'm meeting a friend.



A girl? Is this why you can't decide?



Bye.



I just hope she's Bee-ish.



So they have a huge parade
of just flowers every year in Pasadena?



To be in the Tournament of Roses,
that's every florist's dream!



Up on a float, surrounded
by flowers, crowds cheering.



A tournament. Do the roses
actually compete in athletic events?



No. All right, I've got one.
How come you don't fly everywhere?



It's exhausting. Why don't you
run everywhere? Isn't that faster.



Yeah, OK, I see, I see.
All right, your turn.



TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?
That's insane!



What, you don't have like anything that?



We have Hivo, but it's a disease.
It's a horrible, horrible disease.



Oh, my.



Dumb bees!



You must just want to sting all those jerks.



We really try not to sting.
It's usually fatal for us.



So you really have to watch your temper.



Oh yeah, very carefully.
You kick a wall, take a walk,



write an angry letter and throw it out.
You work through it like any emotion:



Anger, jealousy, lust.



Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?



Yeah.



- What is wrong with you?!
- It's a bug.



Well, he's not bothering anybody.
Get out of here, you creep!



What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?



Yeah, it was. How did you know?



It felt like about 10 pages.
Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.



Boy, you've really got that 
down to a science.



- Oh, we have to. I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
- I'll bet.



What in the name
of Mighty Hercules is this?



How did this get here?
Oute Bee, Golden Blossom,



Ray Liotta Private Select?



- Is he that actor?
- I never heard of him.



- Why is this here?
- For people. We eat it.



Why?



You don't have
enough food of your own?



- Well, yes we.
- How do you even get it?



- Well bees make it.
- I know who makes it!



And it's hard to make it!



There's heating, and cooling, and stirring.
You need a whole Krelman thing!



- It's organic.
- It's our-ganic!



It's just honey, Barry.



Just what?!



Bees don't know about this!
This is stealing! A lot of stealing!



You've taken our homes, our schools,
our hospitals! This is all we have!



And it's on sale?!
I’m going to get to the bottom of this.



I’m going to get to the bottom
of all of this!



Hey, Hector.



- You almost done?
- Almost.



He is here. I sense it.



Well, I guess I'll go home now



and just leave this nice honey out,
with no one around.



You're busted, box boy!



I knew I heard something.
So you can talk!



I can talk.
And now you're going start talking!



Where are you getting all the sweet stuff?
Who's your supplier?



I don't know what you're talking about.
I thought we were all friends.



The last thing we want to do is upset any of you...bees!



You're too late! It's ours now!



You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword!



You, sir, are about to be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio!



Where is the honey coming from?



Tell me where!



Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!



Orazy person!



Oh my, What horrible thing has happened here?



Look at these faces, they never knew what hit them. And now



they're on the road to nowhere!



Just keep still.



What? You're not dead?



Do I look dead? Hey man, They will wipe anything that moves. Now, where you headed?



To Honey Farms.
I am onto something huge here.



I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood,
crazy stuff. Blows your head off!



I'm going to Tacoma.



- What about you?
- He really is dead.



All right.



Uh-oh!



- What is that?!
- Oh, no!



- It's a wiper! Triple blade!
- Triple blade?



Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!



Why does everything have
to be so doggone clean?!



How much do you people need to see?!



Open your eyes!
Stick your head out the window!



From NPR News in Washington,
I'm Oarl Kasell.



But don't kill no more bugs!



- Bee!
- Moose blood guy!!



- You hear something?
- Like what?



Like tiny screaming.



Turn off the radio.



Hey what's up, bee boy?



Hey, Blood.



And it was just an endless row of honey jars,
as far as the eye could see.



Wow!



So I'm just assuming wherever this honey truck goes
that's where they're getting it.



I mean, that honey's ours.



- Bees hang tight.
- Well, we're all jammed in there.



It's a close community.



Not us, man. We on our own.
Every- every mosquito on his own.



- But what if you get in trouble?
- Trouble, You a mosquito, you in trouble.



Nobody likes us. They're just all smack.
See a mosquito, smack, smack!



At least you're out in the world.
You must meet a lot of girls.



Mosquito girls try to trade up,
get with a moth, dragonfly.



Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.



You have got to be kidding me!



Mooseblood's about to leave
the building! So long, bee!



- Hey, guys!
- Mooseblood!



I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
Did you bring your crazy straw?



Then we throw it in some jars, slap a label on it,
and it's pretty much pure profit.



What is this place?



A bee's got a brain
the size of a pinhead.



They are pinheads!



Pinhead.



- Hey check out the new smoker.
- Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.



The Thomas 3000!



Smoker?



Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic.
Twice the nicotine, all the tar.



A couple breaths of this
knocks them right out.



They make the honey,
and we make the money.



"They make the honey,
and we make the money"?



Oh, my!



What's going on? Are you OK?



Yeah. It doesn't last too long.



How did you two get here? 



Do you know you're
in a fake hive with fake walls?



Our queen was moved here.
We had no choice.



This is your queen?
That's a man in women's clothes!



That's a drag queen!



What is this?



Oh, no!



There's hundreds of them!



Bee honey.



Our honey is being brazenly stolen
on a massive scale!



This is worse than anything bears
have done to us! And I intend to do something about it.



Oh, Barry, stop.



Who told you that humans are taking
our honey? That's just a rumor.



Do these look like rumors?



That's a conspiracy theory.
These are obviously doctored photos.



Barry, how did you get mixed up in all this?



Cause, he's been talking to humans.



- What?
- Talking to humans?!



He has a human girlfriend.



Oh, Barry



And they make out!




Make out? Barry!



We do not.



- You wish you could.
- Who's side are you on?



The bees!



I dated a cricket once in San Antonio.
Man, those crazy legs kept me up all night.



Barry, this is what you want
to do with your life?


This is what I want to do for all our lives.
Nobody works harder than bees!




Dad, I remember you
coming home some night so overworked



your hands were still stirring.
You couldn't stop them.



I remember that.



What right do they have to our hard-earned honey?



We're living on two cups a year. They're putttin it
in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!



Even if it's true, Barry, what could one bee do?



I'm going to sting them where it really hurts.



In the face! In the eye!



- That would really hurt.

- No.

Up the nose? That's a killer.

No. There's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it really matters.

Hive at Five, the hive's only full-hour action news source.

No more bee beards!

With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.

Weather with Storm Stinger.

Sports with Buzz Larvi.

And Jeanette Ohung.

- Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble.

- And I'm Jeanette Ohung.

Our top story a tri-county bee, Barry Benson, is saying he intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey, packaging it and profiting from it illegally!

Don't forget tomorrow night on Bee Larry King, we are going have three former queens all right here in our studio, discussing their new book, Olassy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon.

Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.



Did you ever think, "I'm just a kid
from the hive. I can't do this"?



Larry, bees have never been afraid
to change the world.



I mean what about Bee Oolumbus?
Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?



Well, where I'm from you, wouldn't think of suing humans.



We were thinking
more like stickball or candy stores.



How old are you?



I want you to know that the entire bee community
is supporting you in this case,



which is certain to be the trial
of the bee century.



Thank you, Larry. You know, they have a Larry King
in the human world too.



It's a common name. Next week on Bee Larry King...



No, I mean he looks like you and he has a show
and suspenders and colored dots behind him



Next week on Bee Larry King



Old guy glasses, and there’s quotes along the bottom from the
guest you’re watching even though you just heard them.



Bear Week next week!
They're scary, they're hairy and they're here live.



Always leans forward, pointy shoulders,
squinty eyes, very Jewish.



Look, in tennis, you attack
at the point of weakness!



But it was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.



Honey, her backhand's a joke!
I'm not gonna take advantage of that?



Quiet, please.
Actual work going on here.



- Is that that same bee?
- Yes, it is!



I'm helping him sue the human race.



Wha!



- Hello.
- Hello, bee.



This is Ken.



Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size
ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.



Why does he talk again, hun?



Listen, you better go
because we're really busy working.



But it's our yogurt night!



Bye-bye.



Why is yogurt night so difficult?!



You poor thing.
You two have been at this for hours!



Yes, and Adam here
has been a huge help.



- Frosting...
- How many sugars?



Just one. I try not
to use the competition.



So why are you helping me, anyway?



Bees have good qualities.



Si, Certo.



And it feels good to take my mind off the shop.



I don’t know why instead of flowers, people
are giving balloon bouquets now.



Yeah those are great, if you're three.



And artificial flowers.



- Oh, they just get me psychotic!
- Yeah, me too.



The bent stingers, the pointless pollination.



Bees must hate those fake plastic things!



There's nothing worse
than a daffodil that's had work done.



Well, maybe this could make up
for it a little bit.



- You know, Barry. this lawsuit's a pretty big deal.
- I guess.



Are you sure you want to go through with it?



Am I sure? When I'm done with
the humans, they won't be able



to say, "Honey, I'm home,"
without paying a royalty!

Sarah, it's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan, where all eyes and ears of the world are anxiously waiting, because for the first time in history, we’re going to hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak.

What have we gotten into here, Barry?

I don't know, but it's pretty big, isn't it?

I can't believe how many humans don't have to be at work during the day.

Hey you think billion-dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers?

Folks, everybody needs to stay behind the barricade.

- What's the matter?

- I don't know, I just got a chill.

Well, if it isn't the bee team.

Any of you boys work on this?

All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding.

All right. Oase number 4475, Superior Oourt of New York, Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry is now in session.



Mr. Montgomery, you are representing
the five major food companies collectively?



A privilege.



Mr. Benson... you are representing
all the bees of the world?



I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,
we're ready to proceed.



And Mr. Montgomery,
your opening statement, please.



Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,



my grandmother was a simple woman.



Born on a farm, she believed
it was man's divine right



to benefit from the bounty
of nature God put before us.



If we were to live in the topsy-turvy world
Mr. Benson imagines,



just think of what it would mean.



Maybe I would have to negotiate
with the silkworm



for the elastic in my britches!



Talking bee!



How do we know this isn't some sort of



holographic motion-picture-capture
Hollywood wizardry?



They could be using laser beams!



Robotics! Ventriloquism!
Oloning! For all we know,



he could be on steroids!



Mr. Benson?



Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
there's no trickery here.



I'm just an ordinary bee.
And as a bee honey's pretty important to me.



It's important to all bees.
We invented it!



We make it. And we protect it
with our lives.



Unfortunately, there are
some people in this room



who think they can take whatever they want from us



'cause we're the little guys!
And what I'm hoping that, after this is all over,



you'll see how, by taking our honey,
you not only taking away everything we have



but everything we are!



I wish he would dress like that
all the time. So nice!



Oall your first witness.



So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, Pretty big company you have there.

I suppose so.

And I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron!

Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms.

Beekeeper. I find that
to be a very disturbing term.



I have to say



I don't imagine you employ
any bee-free-ers, do you?



- No.
- I’m sorry. I couldn't hear you.



- No.
- No.



Because you don't free bees.
You keep bees. And not only that,



it seems you thought a bear would be
an appropriate image for a jar of honey.



Well, they're very lovable creatures.



Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.



Yean you mean like this?



Bears kill bees!



How would you like his big hairy head crashing
through your living room?!



Biting into your couch!
Spitting out your throw pillows!



OK, that's enough. Take him away.



So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.
Your name intrigues me.



I have to say. 



- Where have I heard it before?
- I was with a band called The Police.



But you've never been
a police officer of any kind, have you?



No, I haven't.



No, you haven't. And so here
we have yet another example



of bee culture being casually
stolen by a human



for nothing more than
a prance-about stage name.



Oh, please.



Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?



Because I'm feeling
a little stung, Sting.



Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!



That's not his real name?! You idiots!



Mr. Liotta, first may,
I offer my belated congratulations on



your Emmy win for a guest spot
on ER in 2005.



Thank you. Thank you.



I also see from your resume
that you're devilishly handsome



but with a churning inner turmoil
that's always ready to blow.



I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?



Not yet it isn't. But is this
what it's come to for you Mr Liotta?



Exploiting tiny, helpless bees
so you don't



have to rehearse
your part and learn your lines, sir?



Watch it, Benson!
I could blow right now!



This isn't a goodfella.
This is a badfella!



Why doesn't someone just step on
this little creep, and we can all go home?!



- Order in this court!
- You're all thinking it!



Order! Order, I say!



- Say it!
- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!



Well, I just think it was awfully nice
of that bear to pitch in like that.



I’m telling you, I think the jury's on our side.



Are we doing everything right, you know, legally?



I'm a florist.



Right. Right. Well, here's to a great team.



To a great team!



Well, hello.



- Ken!
- Hello.



I didn't think you were coming.



No, I was just late.
I tried to call, but... the battery.



I didn't want all this to go to waste,
so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.



Yeah!



Oh, that was lucky.



Well, there's still a little left.
I could heat it up.



Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.



So I hear you're quite a tennis player.



I'm not much for the game myself.
I find the ball's a little grabby.



That's where I usually sit.
Right... there.



Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,



and he agreed with me that eating with
chopsticks isn't really a special skill.



You think I don't see what you're doing?



Hey look I know how hard it is to find
the rightjob. We certainly have that in common.



Do we?



Well, bees have 100 percent employment of course,
but we do jobs like taking the crud out.



That's just what
I was thinking about doing.



Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor
for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.



I'm going to go drain the old stinger.



Yeah, you do that.



Look at that.



Y-yo you known, I've just about had it



with your little mind games.



- What's that?
- Italian Vogue.



Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.



A lot of ads.



Remember what Van said, why is
your life any more valuable than mine?



It's funny, I just can't seem to recall that!



I think something stinks in here!



I love the smell of flowers.



Yeah! How do you like the smell of flames?!



Not as much.



Water bug! Not taking sides!



Ken, look at me! I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!
This is pathetic!



I've got issues!



Well, well, well, a royal flush!



- You're bluffing.
- Am I?



Surf's up, dude!



Poo water!



That bowl is gnarly.



Except for those dirty yellow rings!



Kenneth! What are you doing?!



You know what, I don't even like honey!
I don't eat it!



We need to talk!



He's just a little bee!



And he happens to be
the nicest bee I've met in a long time!



Long time? What are you talking about?!
Are there other bugs in your life?



No, but there are other things bugging
me in life. And you're one of them!



Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...



My nerves are fried from riding
on this emotional roller coaster!



Goodbye, Ken.



And for your information,



I prefer sugar-free, artificial
sweeteners made by man!



I'm so sorry about all that.



I know it's got
an aftertaste! I like it!



I always felt there was some kind
of barrier between Ken and me.



I couldn't overcome it.
Oh, well.



Are you going to be OK for the trial tomorrow?



I believe Mr. Montgomery
is about out of ideas.



We would like to call
Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.



Now that’s a good idea! You can really see why he's
considered one of the best lawyers...



Yeah.



Layton, you've
got to weave some magic



with this jury,
or it's going be all over.



Don't worry Mr Gammil. The only thing I have
to do to turn this jury around



is to remind them
of what they don't like about bees.



- You got the tweezers?
- Are you allergic?



Only to losing, son. Only to losing.



Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you
what I think we'd all like to know.



What exactly is your relationship



to that woman?



We're friends.



- Good friends?
- Yes.



- How good? 
- What?



Do you live together?



Wait a minute, this isn’t about...



Are you her little...



...bedbug?



Hey, that’s not the kind of



I've seen a bee documentary or two.
Now from what I understand,



doesn't your queen give birth
to all the bee children in the hive?



- Yeah, but...
- So those aren't even your real parents!



- Oh, Barry...
- Yes, they are!



Hold me back!



You're an illegitimate bee,
aren't you, Benson?



He's denouncing bees!



And don't y'all date your cousins?



- Objection!
- I'm going to pincushion this guy!



Adam, don't! It's what he wants!



Oh, I'm hit!!



Oh, lordy, I am hit!



Order! Order!



The venom! The venom
is coursing through my veins!



- I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction!
- Please, Mr. Montgomery.


You see? You can't treat them
like equals! They're striped savages!



Stinging's the only thing
they know! It's their way!



- Adam, stay with me.
- I can't feel my legs.



Take it easy



What angel of mercy
will come forward to suck the poison



from my heaving buttocks?



Please! I will have order in this court. Order!



Order, please!



The case of the honeybees
versus the human race took a pointed turn 



- against the bees yesterday when one of their
- Thank you!


legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery. Now here’s Don with the 5-day.



- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.



- Is there much pain?
- Yeah.



I...



I blew the whole case, didn't I?



It doesn't matter. The important thing is 
you're alive. You could have died.



I'd be better off dead. Look at me.



They got it from the cafeteria
they got it from downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.



Look, there's
a little celery still on it.



What was that like to sting someone?



I can't explain it. It was all...



All adrenaline and then...
and then ecstasy!



All right.



You think that was all a trap?



Of course. I'm sorry.
I flew us right into this.



What were we thinking? Look at us. We're
just a couple of bugs in this world.



What do you think the humans will do to us
if they win?



I don't know.



I hear they put the roaches in motels.
That doesn't sound so bad.



Adam, they check in,
but they don't check out!



Oh, my.



Say, could you get a nurse
to close that window?



- Why?
- The smoke.



Bees don't smoke.



Right. Bees don't smoke.



Bees don't smoke!
But some bees are smoking.



Adam, that's it! That's our case!



It is? It's not over?



No, Get up, Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.



You get back to the court and stall.
Stall any way you can.



And assuming you've done step 29 correctly, you're ready for the tub.



Mr. Flayman.



Yes? Yes, Your Honor!



Where is the rest of your team?



Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.



You know Bees are trained to fly kind of haphazardly,



and as a result,
quite often we don't make very good time.



I actually once heard a pretty funny story about a bee...



Your Honor,
haven't these ridiculous bugs



taken up enough
of this court's valuable time?



How much longer are we going to allow
these absurd shenanigans to go on?



They have presented no compelling
evidence to support their charges



against my clients,
who have all run perfectly legitimate businesses.



I move for a complete dismissal
of this entire case!



Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going



to have to consider
Mr. Montgomery's motion.



But you can't! We have a terrific case.



Where is your proof?
Where is the evidence?



Show me the smoking gun!



Hold it, Your Honor!
You want a smoking gun?



Here is your smoking gun.



What is that?



It's a bee smoker!



What, this?
This harmless little contraption?



This couldn't hurt a fly,
let alone a bee.



Members of the jury, look at what has happened



to bees who have never been asked,
"Smoking or non?"



Is this what nature intended for us?



To be forcibly addicted
to these smoke machines



in man-made wooden slat work camps?



Living out our lives as honey slaves
to the white man?



- What are we gonna do?
- He's playing the species card.



Ladies and gentlemen, please,
free these bees!



Free the bees! Free the bees!



Free the bees!



Free the bees! Free the bees!



The court finds in favor of the bees!



Vanessa, we won!



Yay! I knew you could do it! High-five!



Sorry.



'''Barry''': I'm OK! Vanessa do you know what this means?



All the honey is finally going to belong to the bees.



Now we won't have to work so hard all the time.



This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson.



You'll regret this.



Barry, how much honey do you think is out there?



All right. All right. One at a time.



Barry, who are you wearing?



My sweater is Ralph Lauren,
and I have no pants.



- What if Montgomery's right?
- What do you mean?



We've been living the bee way
a long time, 27 million years.



Congratulations on your victory. What are you demand as a settlement?



First, we're going to demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps.



Then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with, every last drop.



We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a filthy, smelly, big-headed bad-breath stink machine. I believe We're all aware of what they do in the woods. Wait for my signal. Take him out.



He'll have nauseous for a few hours, then he'll be fine.



And we will no longer tolerate
bee-negative nicknames...



But it's just a prance-about stage name!



...unnecessary inclusion of honey
in bogus health products



and la-dee-da human
tea-time snack garnishments.



Can't breathe.



Bring it in, boys!



Hold it right there! Good.



Tap it.



Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,
and there's gallons more coming!



- I think we need to shut down!
- Shut down? We've never shut down.



Shut down honey production!



Stop making honey!



Turn your key, sir!



What do we do now?



Cannonball!



We're shutting down honey production!



Mission abort.



Aborting pollination and nectar detail.
Returning to base.



Adam, you wouldn't believe
how much honey was out there.



Oh, yeah?



What's going on around here? Where is everybody?



- Are they out celebrating?
- No, they’re just home.



They don't know what to do.
They're laying out, they're sleeping in.



I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way to San Antonio with a cricket.



At least we got our honey back.



Yeah, but sometimes I think, so what if humans liked our honey? Who wouldn't?



It's the greatest thing in the world!
I was excited to be part of making it.



This was my new desk. This was my
new job. I wanted to do it really well.



And now...



Now I can't.



I don't understand why they're not happy.



We have so much now.



I thought their lives would be better!



They're doing nothing. It's amazing.
Honey really changes people.



You don't have any idea
what's going on, do you?



- What did you want to show me?
- This.



What happened here?



That is not the half of it.



Oh, no. Oh, my.



They're all wilting.



Doesn't look very good, does it?



No.



And who's fault do you think that is?



You know, I'm going to guess bees.



Bees?



Specifically, me.



I guess I didn't think that bees not needing to make honey would affect all these others things.



And it's notjust flowers.
Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.



Well, that's our whole SAT test right there.



So you take away the produce, that affects
the entire animal kingdom.



And then, of course...



The human species?



So if there's no more pollination,



it could all just go south here,
couldn't it?



And I know this is also partly my fault.



How about a suicide pact?



How would we do it?



- I'll sting you, you step on me.
- That just kills you twice.



Right, right.



Listen, Barry...
sorry, but I gotta get going.



I had to open my mouth and talk.



Vanessa?



Vanessa? Why are you leaving?
Where are you going?



To the final Tournament of Roses parade
in Pasadena.



They've moved it up to this weekend
because all the flowers are dying.



It's the last chance
I'll ever have to see it.



Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.
I never meant it to turn out like this.



I know. Me neither.



Tournament of Roses.
Roses can't do sports.



Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?



Roses!



Vanessa!



Roses?!



Barry?



- Roses are flowers!
- Yes, they are.



Flowers, bees, pollen!



I know.
That's why this is the last parade.



Maybe not.
Oould you ask him to slow down?



Oould you slow down?



Barry!



OK, I made a huge mistake.
This is a total disaster, and it's all my fault.



Yes, it kind of is.



I've ruined the planet.
and I wanted to help you



with your flower shop. Intead,
I've made it worse.



Actually, it's completely closed down.



I thought maybe you were remodeling.



Nonetheless I have another idea, and it's
greater than all my previous great ideas combined.



I don't want to hear it!



All right, here’s what I’m thinking. they have the roses, the roses have the pollen.



I know every bee, plant
and flower bud in this park.



All we got to do is get what they've got back here with what we've got.



- Bees.
- Park.



- Pollen!
- Flowers.



- Repollination!
- Across the nation!



Alright Tournament of Roses,
Pasadena, Oalifornia.



They've got nothing but flowers, floats and cotton candy.



Security will be tight.



I have an idea.



Vanessa Bloome, FTD.



Official floral business. It's real.



Sorry, ma'am. That's a nice brooch by the way.



Thank you. It was a gift.



Then once we're inside, we just pick the right float.



How about The Princess and the Pea? 



Yeah!



I could be the princess, and 



...yes, I think



You could be 



I’ve-



The pea!



'''Barry''': Yes, I got it. Sorry I’m late. Where should I sit?

'''Princess''': What are you?

'''Barry''': I believe I'm the pea.

'''Princess''': The pea? It’s supposed to be under the mattresses.



- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.
- I’m going to go talk to the marshall.



You do that!
This whole parade is a fiasco!



Let's see what this baby will do.



Hey, what are you doing?!



Then all we do is blend in with traffic...



...without arousing suspicion.



And once we're at the airport,
there's no stopping us.



Stop! Security.



- Did you and your insect pack your own float?
- Yes.



Has this float been
in your possession the entire time?



Would you remove your shoes and
everything in your pockets??



- Can you remove your stinger. Sir?
- That's part of me.



I know. Just having some fun.
Enjoy your flight.



Then if we're lucky, we'll have just enough pollen to do the job.



Oan you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough pollen to do the job!



I think this is going to work Vanessa.



It's got to work.



Attention, passengers, this is Oaptain Scott.



I’m afraid we have a bit of bad weather in the New York area.



And looks like we’re going to be experiencing a couple of hours delay.



Barry, these are cut flowers with no water. They'll never make it.



I’ve got to get up there and talk
to these guys.



Be careful.



Hey can I get some help with this Sky Mall magazine?



I'd like to order the talking inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.



Excuse me! Captain, I'm in a real situation here.



- What did you say, Hal?
- I didn’t say anything.



Bee!



No, no! Don't freak out! There’s
a chance my entire species...



What are you doing? Stop!



- Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!
- Who's an attorney?



Don't move.



Oh, Barry.



Good afternoon, passengers.
This is your captain speaking.



Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B
please report to the cockpit?



And please hurry!



What happened here?



I tried to talk to them, but then 
there was a Dustbuster, a toupee, a life raft exploded.



Now one's bald, one's in a boat,
And they're both unconscious!



- Is that another bee joke?
- No!



No one's flying the plane!



This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.
What's your status?



This is Vanessa Bloome.
I'm a florist from New York.



Where's the pilot?



He's unconscious, and so is the copilot.



Not good. Is there anyone onboard who has flight experience?



As a matter of fact, there is.



- Who's that?
- Barry Benson.



From the honey trial?! Oh, great.

Vanessa, this is nothing more than a big metal bee.



It's got giant wings, huge engines.



I can't fly a plane.



- Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?
- Yes.

How hard could it be?



Wait a minute, Barry! We're headed into some lightning.



This is Bob Bumble. We have some
late-breaking news from JFK Airport,



where a very suspenseful scene is developing.



Barry Benson, fresh off his stunning legal victory...



That's Barry!



...is now attempting to land a plane, loaded with people, flowers and an incapacitated flight crew.



Flowers?!



Well, we have an electrical storm in the area, 
and two individuals at the controls of a jumbo jet



with absolutely no flight experience.

Just a minute Mr Ditchwater. There's a honey bee on that plane.

I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson's work and his no-account compadres.



Haven't they done enough damage already.



But isn't he your only hope right now?



Come on technically, a bee shouldn't be able to fly at all.



The wings are too small their bodies are too big....



Hey hold on a second Haven't we heard this a million times?



"The surface area of the wings and body mass doesn't make sense."



- Get this on the air! You got it.



- Stand by.
- We're going live.



Mr Ditchwater. the way we work may be a mystery to you.



Because making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs.



But let me tell you something about a small job.



If you do it really well, it makes a big difference.



More than we realized. To us, to everyone.



That's why I want to get bees
back to doing what we do best working together.



That's the bee way!
We're not made of Jell-O.



We get behind a fellow.



- Black and yellow!
- Hello!



Left, right, down, hover.



- Hover?
- Forget hover.



You know what? This isn't so hard.
Beep-beep! Beep-beep!



Barry, what happened?!



Wait a minute, I think we were
on autopilot that whole time.



- That may have been helping me.
- And now we're not!



Well then it turns out I cannot fly a plane.



All of you, let's get
behind this fellow! Move it out!



Move out!



Our only chance is if I do what I would do,
and you copy me with the wings of the plane!



You don't have to yell.



I'm not yelling!
We happen to be in a lot of trouble here.



It's very hard to concentrate
with that panicky tone in your voice!



It's not a tone. I'm panicking!



I don't think I can't do this!



Vanessa, pull yourself together. Listen to me. You have got to snap out of it!



You snap out of it.



You snap out of it.



- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!



- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!



- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!



You snap!



- Hold it!
- Why? Come on, it's my turn.



How is the plane flying?



I don't know.



Hello?



Hey Benson, have you got any flowers for a happy occasion in there?



The Pollen Jocks!



They do get behind a fellow.



- Black and yellow.
- Hello.



All right, you two, what do you say we drop this tin can on the blacktop? 



What Blacktop? Where? I can't see anything. Can you?



No, nothing. It's all cloudy.



Come on. You got to think bee, Barry.



- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.



Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!



Wait a minute. I think I'm feeling something.



- What?
- I don't know. But it's strong, and it's pulling me. Like a 27-million-year-old instinct. Bring the nose of the plane down.

Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

- What in the world is on the tarmac?
- Get some lights on that!

Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!



- Vanessa, aim for the flower.
- OK.



- Cut the engines. 
- Cut the engines. We're going in on bee power. Ready, boys?

Affirmative!



Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.



Land on that flower!



Ready boys? Full reverse!



Spin it around!



- Not that flower! The other one!
- Which one?



- That flower.
- I'm aiming at the flower!



That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.
I mean the giant black and yellow pulsating flower made of millions of bees!



Pull forward. Nose down. Bring your tail up.



Rotate around it.



- This is insane, Barry!
- This's the only way I know how to fly.



Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane flying in an insect-like pattern?



Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid of it.
Smell it. Full reverse!



Easy just drop it. Be a part of it.



Aim for the center! Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!

Come on, already.

Barry, we did it!
You taught me how to fly!

- Yes. No high-five!
- Right.
Barry, it worked! Did you see the giant flower?
What giant flower? Where? Of course, I saw the flower! That was genius man! Genius!
- Thank you.
- But we're not done yet.

Listen, everyone! This runway is covered with the last pollen from the last flowers available anywhere on Earth. That means this is our last chance. We're the only ones who make honey, pollinate flowers and dress like this. If we're going to survive as a species, this is our moment! So, what do you say? Are we going to be bees, or just Museum of Natural History keychains?

:Bees: We're bees!



Keychain!


'''Barry''': Then follow me! Except Keychain.

Hold on, Barry. Here.

You've earned this.

Yeah!

Yay!

'''Barry''': I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves. Oh, yeah.



That's our Barry.



Boy: Mom! The bees are back!



If anybody needs to make a call, now's the time. I got a feeling we'll be working late tonight!



Here's your change. Have a great afternoon! Yes, can I help who's next?



Would you like some honey with that?
It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.



Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me. And I don't see a nickel! Sometimes I just feel like a piece of meat!



I had no idea.



Barry, I'm sorry. Have you got a moment?



Would you excuse me? My mosquito here associate be able will help you.


Sorry I'm late.


He's a lawyer too?


Ma’am I was already a blood-sucking parasite. All I needed was a briefcase.


Have a great afternoon!


Barry, I just got this huge tulip order for a wedding, and I can't get them anywhere.

No problem, Vannie. Just leave it to me.

You're a lifesaver, Barry. Can I help who's next? Who's next?

All right, scramble, jocks! It's time to fly.

Thank you, Barry!


That bee is living my life!
Let it go, Kenny.
- When will this nightmare end?!
- Let it all go.

Beautiful day to fly.
Sure is.
Between you and me, I was dying to get out of that office.

THE END.
